          <h3>Best Practices for Tracking Daily Usage</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Built-in Monitoring Tools:</strong> Many modern heat pumps come with built-in monitoring tools and smart controls. 
              Use these features to access real-time data on energy consumption, performance, and more. If you are unsure, it is best to consult your heat pump documentation or contact
              your provider.

              <h4>Install Energy Monitoring Devices</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Smart Thermostats:</strong> These devices can provide detailed insights into your heat pumpâ€™s operation and energy usage. Some models offer features like usage reports and remote monitoring through mobile apps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Energy Monitors:</strong> Separate energy monitors can be installed to measure the electricity consumption of your heat pump specifically. These devices can give you a clearer picture of how much energy your system uses daily.

          <h4>Analyze the Data</h4>
          <p>Regular analysis of your heat pump's energy consumption data is crucial. Identify patterns and anomalies in daily usage to make informed decisions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review energy consumption trends over time to identify periods of high usage.</li>
            <li>Adjust your heat pump settings based on your daily and seasonal needs to optimize performance.</li>
            <li>Consult with energy management tools or professionals to interpret the data effectively and make necessary adjustments.</li>
